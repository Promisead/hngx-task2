## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories

Create a movie discovery web application that allows users to search for movies, view details about them, and save their favorite movies. Youâ€™ll be consuming data from the TMDB API. Requirements are stated below:

- User Interface:
  Create a responsive and visually appealing user interface for the application. Here's the link to the design you're expected to replicate:.
  You should list the top 10 movies on the homepage.
  They should be displayed in a grid layout with their movie posters.
  The Card component should display the movie title and release date.
  card - [data-testid: movie-card]
  movie poster - [data-testid: movie-poster]
  movie title - [data-testid: movie-title]
  movie release date - [data-testid: movie-release-date]

- Movie Search:
  Implement a search feature that allows users to search for movies by title.
  Display search results, including movie posters, titles, and release dates.
  Show a loading indicator while fetching search results.

- Movie Details:
  When i go to to /movies/:id route (where :id is the imdb_id), I should see the movie details page.
  I should see
  title - [data-testid: movie-title]
  release date (in UTC) - [data-testid: movie-release-date]
  runtime (in minutes) - [data-testid: movie-runtime]
  overview - [data-testid: movie-overview]

- API Integration:
  Consume the TMDB API to fetch movie data.
  Use the following API endpoints:
  Fetch movie details by ID: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}

- Error Handling:
  Implement error handling to display meaningful error messages to users in case of API failures or other issues.

- Submission:
  Host your frontend application on a platform of your choice (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
  Provide clear instructions on how to run your project locally in your README.md file.
  Ensure that the code is well-documented and organized.

- Update:
  Because of your numerous tags and DMs, We've decided, your design doesn't need to be perfect, Also not implementing the Search feature won't make you fail.
  Final One: Add to Favourites is not expected to be functional, just add small interaction on the icon/button(e.g change the background colour when it's clicked). If you make it functional you're a senior dev and you won't be penalised

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS (NOT USED!!!)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

- Still trying to figure out a way to use Environment variables to store sensitive information (API keys) outside of the code.
- Search functionality implemented, but not so for favourite functionality, because amnesty taken as granted by mentors. Lols.

### Continued development

- More HNG 10 Projects, TypeScript, Open Source and Technical Writing, Edgi Projects.
